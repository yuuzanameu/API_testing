  ```
  {
      "full_name": string,
      "email": string,
      "password": string,
      "confirm_password": string
  }
  
   ```
  
  which will return you an authentication jwt which should be sent with reqs to protected admin routes such as the admin's dashboard (api/v1/admin/dashboard).
  
  you will recieve a JSON payload of the form:
  
  ``` json
  {
          email: string,
          id: number, 
          token: string(jwt token)
      }
  
   ```
}
